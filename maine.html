<p>I chose Umaine for many reasons:</p>

<li>Orono, the town that UMaine is in, is almost entirely populated by college students.</li>



<li>Friendly atmosphere, helpful and resourceful academic administration.</li>


<li>am a transfer student now at Umaine and I w ill work hard to achieve my goals. </li>
